# CLI-Tool
Building CLI tool with Click

## What it does

This is a basic cookbook for building command-line tools:

* Click tool with full continous integration (CI)
* Docker CLI


## Why is a Containerized CLI so Useful?
Containerization of a CLI can add significant value in various ways. Here are five reasons why:

   * Portability: A containerized CLI is designed to be portable, making it easier to run on any machine with the same environment. This portability eliminates the need for users to install dependencies or configure the environment, making it simpler to distribute the tool and reduce any compatibility issues.

   * Consistency: Containers create a consistent environment, so any tool or application running inside it can expect the same environment every time. This helps to eliminate any environment-related issues and ensures that the tool will work as expected.

   * Isolation: Containerization provides isolation from the host operating system and other containers, making it easier to test and deploy the tool without any interference from other running processes or applications. Additionally, this isolation enhances the security of the tool, as it is harder for attackers to access the host system through the container.

   * Scalability: A containerized CLI can be easily scaled to meet increased demand or processing requirements. Users can scale up or down the resources dedicated to the container, such as CPU, memory, and storage, without affecting the host system or other containers.

   * Ease of Deployment: Containers can be easily deployed to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, making it easier to deploy and manage a CLI tool for users around the world. It also helps to ensure that the tool's dependencies and configurations are consistent across different environments.
